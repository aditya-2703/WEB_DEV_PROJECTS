        <!-- PARAGRAPH -->
        <P>The modern lifestyle has a number of advantages which includes easing peoples life, saving hundreds of peoples lives by the new development of medicine and vaccines. On the other hand different modern life style patterns have negative effects on health physically, psychologically, and socially. One of these modern ways of living is the high intake of fast foods. This is due to specific reasons such as the short time specified for eating and choosing healthy food. Lack of physical activity combination with fast foods leads to bad effects on the heart’s health. Use of high technology machines is another way of modernity. Although use of these machines has helped in saving the time to do a lot of tasks, the wrong use of them will indirectly affect health. Another point is the advanced transportation which reduces the time needed to travel and made travelling an enjoyable time. Last, is the use of computers and internet in the communication, transfer of information, and entertainment as well. Altogether will constitute the elements of a sedentary life style. That means, high fatty foods intake and lack of physical activity. Which both are caused by fast foods, depending on high technology machines and transportation, and sitting long hours in front of the computer.</P>

        <p>Impact of Modern Lifestyle on Human Health
            Lifestyle maybe a manner applied by individuals, groups, and nations, and is made with specific geographical, political, economic, cultural and spiritual text. 
            Lifestyle is referred to like the characteristics of the residents of a locality at a particular time and place. It includes day-to-day behaviors and functions of people in activities, jobs, fun, and diet.
            
            In recent decades, lifestyle as a crucial factor of health has become a very interesting topic among the researchers because 60 percent of related factors to quality of life and individual health are correlated to the human lifestyle. 
            
            Millions of people in the world follow an unhealthy lifestyle; therefore, they have to face illness, disability, and even death. 
            Many critical issues like joint and skeletal problems, metabolic diseases, overweight, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, violence and so on, may be caused by an unhealthy lifestyle. 
            The connection between lifestyle and health ought to be extremely considered.
            
            Today, wide changes have occurred within the lifetime of all individuals.  Unhealthy diet, malnutrition, alcohol consuming, smoking, drug abuse, stress, anxiety and so on, are the demonstrations of an unhealthy lifestyle that they are used as an effective form of lifestyle. 
            
            Apart from this, citizens have to face new challenges in their lives. For example, rising new technologies within the Internet and virtual communication networks, take our world to major challenges which lead people to physical and mental health problems. The challenge is the misuse and excessive use of technology.
            
            Therefore, according to the current studies, it may be aforementioned that: lifestyle has a considerable effect on human physical and mental health. 
            
            There are completely different types of these effects. In some ethnicities, consanguinity or cognition is a major form of lifestyle that may cause genetic diseases. 
            Improvement in this unhealthy lifestyle is a preventive factor to reduce the rate of genetic disorders. 
            
            In some countries, the misuse or overuse of medicine may be a major unhealthy lifestyle. Whereas self-medication like antibiotics has a negative impact on the immune system. 
            
            If the person is affected by any type of infection, then antibiotics won't be effective in the treatment. 
            Overall, 10 percent of self-medicated people may experience serious complications such as drug resistance. Occasionally drug allergy is so serious that it can cause death.

        <h2><CENTER>HOW MODERN LIFE AFFECTS OUR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH</CENTER>
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <h2><li>Happiness</li></h2>
                <p>A recent study led by researchers at Indiana University explored the so-called friendship paradox experienced by users of social media. The friendship paradox finds that, on average, most people are less popular than their friends on social media, which may lead to reduced happiness.

                    “As far as we’re aware, it’s never been previously shown that social media users are not only less popular than their friends on average but also less happy,” said lead study author Johan Bollen, associate professor in the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing.
                    
                    “This study suggests that happiness is correlated with popularity, and also that the majority of people on social networks aren’t as happy as their friends due to this correlation between friendship and popularity.”
                    
                    Overall, the research found that users of social media might experience increased levels of social dissatisfaction and unhappiness as a result of comparing their happiness and popularity to that of their friends.
                    
                    “Happy social media users may think their friends are more popular and slightly happier than they are – and unhappy social media users will likely have unhappy friends who still seem happier and more popular than they are on average,” Prof. Bollen explained.</p>
                <h2><li>Isolation</li></h2>
                <p>People tend to spend more time on social media instead of   practising real-time activities. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh show that   the people between the age group 19 to 32 tend to spend most of their time on social   media platforms.

                    Since they spend most of their time online they become isolated from their family and develop no interest in any physical activities. Due to this mental problems have started to increase epidemically amongst the teenagers.
                    
                    Man is a social animal; however social media platforms have started to bring in the distance in physical activities and increased virtual relationships.</p>
                <h2><li>Depression</li></h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the increase in the amount of time spent on social media, teenagers tend to become victims of depression. Researchers have found half of the teenagers indulged on social media platforms having signs of depression.

                    Depression affects the mental health of people making them feel down and detached. Similarly, long hours on social media involve no physical activity increasing the problems of obesity amongst the people.</p>
                <h2><li>Video gaming and aggression</li></h2><p>Video gaming is another area that has gained a bad reputation, with some research suggesting a link between video games and violence. However, a study published in the Journal of Communication found no such link between aggression observed in movies and video games, and real life violence.</p>

    <h2>CONCLUSIONS :</h2>
    <p>This study reports the presence of addiction for internet (1.3%–2% males and 0.6% females) and cell phone (4.1%–2.5% males and 1.5% females) [Table 1]. A total of 1051 participants reported that they are using Facebook as social network media with a mean of 20.48. It was more common among males [Table 2]. Significant differences were observed in relation to family status for internet and mobile phone use with more common among single/nuclear families. Technology addictions were found more common among single families and lesser in nuclear and joint families [Tables ​[Tables33 and ​and4].4]. Mobile phone users had psychiatric distress in comparison to users with internet addiction [Table 5]. The study showed negative correlation of age, years of marriage, and number of members in the family with internet addiction and mobile overuse [Table 6].

        Qualitative data indicated that 3.3% of internet users and 5% of the mobile users of surveyed population showed motivation to change their pattern of use. Nearly 2.1% of internet users and 4.1% of mobile users showed their intention to change the monthly expenses for the same. Almost 6.8% of mobile overusers and 5.3% with internet addiction had psychiatric distress.
        
        It was corroborated by the available work that 24.6% of problematic users in the age group of 18–25 years have psychiatric distress.(14) Whereas 5% of youth in the same age group has addictive use of social networking sites.[15] A study among 3399 Norwegian adults in the age group of 16–74 years reported the prevalence of internet addiction as 1.0% and an additional 5.2% were at-risk internet users. Internet addiction and at-risk internet use were strongly dependent on gender and age with highest prevalence among young males.[20] Dependent internet users included larger proportion of men than women (71% men and 29% women) than the nondependent users.[21] Males were more likely to be pathological users (12% vs. 3%) than females, whereas females were more likely to have no symptoms (28% vs. 26%) or have limited symptoms (69% vs. 61%) of behavioral pathology than males.[22] Internet addiction was more common among men than women.[23] The youth in the age group of 18–21 years reported loss of control in relation to usages of social networking.[24] Treatment seeker for mental health problems at a tertiary hospital had comorbid addiction to mobile, internet, video game, and pornography.[25]
        
        This study documents the presence of technology addiction in the Indian community. It has implications for studying the pattern of technology addictions and evolving program for enhancing community awareness at school/college/community level and preparation of resource materials on technology addiction.</p>
